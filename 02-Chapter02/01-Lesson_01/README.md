## Linear Regression

The two main families of predictives machine learning algorithms:

* Classification;
    * Answers question: `Yes` or `No`, Spam/not, Sick/not;
* Regression.
    * Answers question: How much.

This section is all about the **Linear Regression**.

### Line Equation

Recall the line equation in Figure 1.

![Figure 1 - Line Equation](01-img/nd025_c2_l01_01.png)

Where:

* $w_1$: slope, and;
* $w_2$: intercept.

$$y = w_1 x + w_2 \tag{1}$$
