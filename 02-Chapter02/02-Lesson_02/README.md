## Perceptron

The Perception is the elementary component of the Neural Network. It is similar to the Linear Regression but aiming to perform the classification instead of a predict a value. Figure 1 shows an example.

By the using of the adopt model (a Linear Equation) it is possible to classify (or predict) if a student will be accept or reject. Figure 2 shows the simplified notation of the Perceptron.
